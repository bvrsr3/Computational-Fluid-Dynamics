# Rayleigh-Benard-Convection
## Introduction
Rayleigh-B´enard convection is a type of natural convection flow that is only driven by differences in
density due to a temperature gradient. The Rayleigh-B´enard convection occurs in a volume of fluid
that is heated from below. In the case studied in this report, the fluid is kept between two enclosing
parallel plates and the lower plate is kept at a higher temperature.
The fluid near the lower plate will get a higher temperature and therefore, a lower density than the rest
of the fluid. Gravity will make the colder and heavier fluid at the top sink, but this is opposed by the
viscous force in the fluid. It is the balance between these two forces that determines if convection will
occur or not. If the temperature gradient, and thus the density gradient, is large enough, the gravitational
forces will dominate, and instability will occur. It is the occuring flow patterns that are investigated in
this report through numerical methods.
