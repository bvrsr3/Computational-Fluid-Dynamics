The Lid-Driven cavity problem has been solved numerically for Reynolds number 100. The code has been written in C language.
The code follows a Finite Volume Framework (FVM).
SIMPLE algorithm is used. The fluxes are reconstructed at the face using Rhie-Chow interpolation.
The results have been validated against Gaia 1982.
